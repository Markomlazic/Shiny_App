Overview

This R Presentation contains the documentation for the Shiny Application that predicts Horsepower of motor vehicles based on their engine displacement. The Shiny Application can be found at the following [web page] (https://markomml.shinyapps.io/new_app/)

This Application uses a linear model to predict Horsepower from Displacement using the data from the mtcars package, creates a plot and returns predicted values from two different linear models.

The App was build using the Shiny package. The source code is contained within 2 files:
- `ui.R`
- `server.R`

Both files can be found here: [GitHub](https://github.com/Markomlazic/Shiny_App/tree/master)
